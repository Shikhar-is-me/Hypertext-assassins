WHAT OUR PROJECT IS ABOUT:

Our project basically is about trying to help improve the grey matter in the human brains.

the grey matter is the part responsible for muscle control and sensory perception skills such as seeing and hearing; memory function; and emotion, speech, decision formation - it also promotes better connectivity in certain subregions of the brain associated with these functions.

Studies have shown that some video games can boost mood and make for better heart rhythms, which is another benefit to us.

also we want to add a few games that help people develop/improve problem-solving skills.
